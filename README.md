Our main goal in this stage is to create a smart contract that will compute automatically a trust score for each CSP.
Tools used : 
### Ethereum :
Ethereum is a decentralized exchange protocol allowing the creation of smart contracts by users. These smart contracts are based on a computer protocol allowing a mutual contract to be verified or implemented
### ganache :
The term “Ganache” refers to a tool that is used on the Ethereum blockchain . This tool will allow developers to carry out tests 
when they wish to deploy a contract on the blockchain with the aim of carrying out tests.
### truffle: 
Write scripts and plugins to automate common processes. Interact directly with the blockchain using the Truffle console.
### Solidity:
a programming language for smart contract
### Meta Mask:
MetaMask is a cryptocurrency software wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.
